    This File is for Battle Pet Completionist.
    It is meant to help brainstorm the Implementation of the FR "Calendar
    Reminders" ... FR Link:
    https://github.com/GurliGebis/WoWAddon-BattlePetCompletionist/issues/86

    This has two arrays incase of variance later on by Blizzard.
    One is for World Quests and one is for Daily Quests

    The data is in a Multi-Layered Hash Table with format:
        EventID -- English name in comment for ease of maintaining
            PetHash of Pet NPC ID & Pet Species ID
                WoW Head Base URL: https://www.wowhead.com/npc=
                Add NPC ID and the display shows the Species ID
